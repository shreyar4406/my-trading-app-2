# 📈 Trading App — Stock Market Simulation Platform

## Introduction

**Trading App** is a full-stack web application that simulates a real-time stock trading environment. Built as a college project, it allows users to register, log in, browse live (simulated) stock market data, buy and sell stocks, track their portfolio performance, and view their complete transaction history — all through a clean, responsive interface.

The backend is powered by **Spring Boot (Java)** with JWT-based authentication and an in-memory H2 database, while the frontend is built using **React.js** with Recharts for data visualization.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd my-trading-app
```

### 2. Run the Backend
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
The backend will start on **http://localhost:8080**

> The H2 console is available at **http://localhost:8080/h2-console**
> - JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:tradingdb`
> - Username: `sa`
> - Password: `password`

### 3. Run the Frontend

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Register** with a username, email, and password — you start with **$10,000** virtual cash.
2. **Browse the Market** to see 15 stocks with live-simulated prices updating every 15 seconds.
3. **Trade** by clicking the Trade button on any stock, selecting BUY or SELL, and entering a quantity.
4. **Monitor your Portfolio** to see your holdings, average cost basis, current market value, and unrealized P&L.
5. **Review History** for a complete audit trail of every transaction.
